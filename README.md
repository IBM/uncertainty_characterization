# Uncertainty Characterization

This repository contains the code for the uncertainty characterization approach described in our paper "Uncertainty Analysis in Predicting Molecular Properties Using Chemical Foundation Models". 

If you use this method in your work, please cite our paper from AAAI 2025 Workshop on AI to Accelerate Science and Engineering (AI2ASE) that describes it in full detail:
